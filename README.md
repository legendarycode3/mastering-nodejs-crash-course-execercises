**MASTERING NODE.JS CRASh COURSE**



**Requirement / Prerequisites** </br>
1.JavaScript fundamentals (functions, loops, objects, classes etc) </br>
2. Asynchronous programming - Promise, callbacks, async/await.  </br>
3. HTTP Basics  (Methods, status codes, etc)  </br>
4. How JSON APIs work.  </br>


**Setting Development Environment** <br/>
**Browser** <br/>
There are many browsers out there but most developers prefer to use Google Chrome or FireFox. I usually use Google chrome for development and I recommend it too. Download https://www.google.com/chrome/ Google Chrome if you do not have one.

The browser render your HTML code to a human read website.


**Back-end development:**  Deals with the server, database, and application logic that powers the website or application. Back-end development (the server, database, and application logic), often requiring a blend of creative problem-solving and technical skills to deliver smooth and efficient user experiences. <br/>
The backend interacts with frontend and the database using a backend programming language that could be (Node.js, Python, Ruby, PHP, etc). Look at the following figure to understand the interaction between client. A client send a HTTP request to the backend and the backend return a HTTP response to the client computer(The response could be an HTML page, txt, image, or any other form of data). HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a communication protocol that allow transmitting data between a client and a sever. It is designed for communication between web browsers(client) and web servers.  <br/>


**Code Editor** <br/>

As web developer, you should write code using a text or code editor. Therefore, to write HTML code, CSS, JS, React etc. You need to have a code editor.

I will use Visual studio code and I will use it in this challenge too. I strongly suggest to use Visual Studio Code because it has lots of productivity extensions that makes super productive. Now, let's download https://code.visualstudio.com/Download visual studio code. <br/>

➡️ What is Node.js ?  <br/>
a)“Node.js” is an open-source “Javascript runtime”. <br/>
b)“Node.js” Uses the “v8 Javascript engine” that Google chrome uses. Built on C++. <br/>
c)“Node.js” is basically used for deveoping “server-side and networking apps/apis”. <br/>
d)“Node.js” takes Javascript out of the browser . <br/>
e)“Node.js” is fast, scalable and popular in many areas of the industry. <br/>
f)“Node.js” is used by companies like “Netflix, Uber, Linkedin, startups” <br/>


➡️ HOW NODE.JS  WORKS - LESSON 1  <br/>

<img src="Images/how-nodejs-works-1.png" width="100">

a)V8 JS Engine: Node.js, is built under the “v8 JS Engine” same engine that powers google chrome & it is written in C++. <br/>

b)Non-Blocking: Node.js is what we call “non-blocking”, which means that , it doesnot wait around for I/o operations. <br/>

c)Single Threaded: Refers to javascript execution model, specifically the event loop. <br/>
Node.js  executes your javascript code within a “single main thread”. This means that, at any given point , only one piece of your javascript code, is likely running. <br/>

d)Event Loop: Node.js uses an event loop , which is a mechanism that allows Node, “to perform non-blocking I/o operations”. <br/>
